# A odin ggpu compute library in odin
Code a bit sloppy, and everything else. Burnout rn so. And i have no clue on how to make libraries so
## Dependencies:
- wgpu [wgpu-odin](https://github.com/Capati/wgpu-odin)

## Documentation 
Too lazy as of now, so docs are code

## Examples:
There is an example in the examples folder

## TODO:
- [ ] Maybe make use of sdl3gpu?
